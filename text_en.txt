# WordCamp Ogijima 2018 Checkpoints for Creating Slides
For Speakers

the Venue: School Gymnasium
To secure airiness, there will be natural light.

## Venue Layout as of 2018.6.15
Podium, Projector and Screen (1800×3600mm) on stage
There will be 200 people on mattress (sit on floor) or seats.
The area of venue is 18m×36m.

## When creating slides
A large venue with natural light, one screen only at front, hot gymnasium in summer…
Please cooperate in creating clear and easy-to-read slides.

- Use large letters
- Contrasty
- Lower cognitive load

## Basic Format
Slide Ratio ＝ 16 : 9 （recommended） 
※ Ratio other than 4 : 3 can be displayed
Reference :  Maximum resolution of projector is 1920×1200

Insert a cover slide on 1st slide（before slide title）
This is a common slide used in-between sessions.  Image for cover slide will be shared later.

## Size and Thickness
### Letters to be BIG
Please use big letter size, including letters within diagram etc.
Consider dividing slides, or use simple words to limit the no. of letters used in one slide.

### Be careful of thick letters, thin letters
Using too thick letters makes it difficult to read.  Please secure contrast and size by limiting the usage of extreme thick letters and thin letters to heading and chapter door.

## Line Space and Line Break
### Appropriate line space
Sentences are difficult to read when line space is too clogged or too much room.

### Break line with meaning
When using multiple lines, it becomes easy to read when line breaks with words or phrase, not an automatic return.

## Contrast
Strong contrast between font and background color
We recommend over 7:1 ratio rate for basic font color and background color
Check tool example： http://contrast-ratio.com/

ex1）Background: dark-blue (#0C1136) / Font: white (#FFFFFF) ＝ Contrast Ratio 18.28
→Great!
ex2）Background: blue (#4484C0) / Font: white (#FFFFFF) ＝ Contrast Ratio 3.95
ex3）Background: white (#FFFFFF) / Font: yellowish green (#90B44B) ＝ Contrast Ratio 2.38
→ May seem fine but stronger contrast is better
ex4）Background: pale blue (#D8EEF6) / Font: dark grey (#4E4E4E) ＝ Contrast Ratio 6.92
→Difficult…

※Try to keep a strong contrast like the one on left.

## Photo and Text
Adding word layer on photo is not recommended this time.
There is a possibility that both photo and letters become difficult to read.

To impress image and words, have a try to lay solid color or divide text area and image.

## Color
Communicating information other than color.
When using several colors for graphs or diagrams, it is recommended to add text, shapes, patterns, and moves, so information can be communicated other than color.

## Other
- Double check typos … Remove factors that may distract listeners attention.
- Don’t place important element atbottom of slide … Prevent “I can’t see because of the head of a person sitting in front…”
